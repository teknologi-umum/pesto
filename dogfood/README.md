# Dogfood

Eating your own dog food or "dogfooding" is the practice of using one's own
products or services.
This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage
using product management techniques.
Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of
testimonial advertising. Once in the market,
dogfooding can demonstrate developers' confidence in their own products.

Definition was acquired
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). But

This part of the code is meant to make sure that the Pesto API (most notably the
RCE)
is working as intended from the user perspective.
