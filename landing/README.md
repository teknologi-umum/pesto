# Landing module

This service provides frontend for Pesto. Written using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) integration.

The frontpage of Pesto should give information about what Pesto is, how people can benefit through it, and how to register for

access token. Documentation on HTTP API should also be documented on the web, alongside with Postman collection or HAR file.
